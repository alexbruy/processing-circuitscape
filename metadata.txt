name=Circuitscape for Processing
description=Predict connectivity in heterogeneous landscapes
about=Circuitscape is a free software package that borrows algorithms from electronic circuit theory to predict connectivity in heterogeneous landscapes. Its most common applications include modeling movement and gene flow of plants and animals, as well as identifying areas important for connectivity conservation. Developed by Alexander Bruy for Faunalia (http://faunalia.eu) funded by Prof. António Mira (University of Évora, Portugal, Unidade de Biologia da Conservação) and Dr. Rosana Peixoto PhD.
